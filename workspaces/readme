coammds to create the workspaces
----------------------
Create a New Workspace

terraform workspace new <env> dev, uat, prod
---------------------
List All Workspaces

terraform workspace list == This shows all available workspaces. The one you are currently using will have an asterisk (*) next to it.

--------------
Show Current Workspace

terraform workspace show == If you just want to know the name of the workspace you are currently in without seeing the whole list
--------------
Switch (Select) a Workspace

terraform workspace select <env> prod, uat, dev == To move from one environment to another, use the select command.
-----------------

Delete a Workspace

terraform workspace delete <env> uat, prod, dev === To remove a workspace and its associated state file:
** Safety Check: You cannot delete the workspace you are currently "inside." You must select a different one (like default) before deleting.

Resource Check: Terraform will prevent you from deleting a workspace if it still contains active resources (infrastructure).
 You should run terraform destroy first.
